# Day 2 - Understanding WAS Credential Content Outline
Today, I started to get a bit deeper into the WAS credential content outline. Personally, I think it is helpful to understand and what to focus on when preparing for the exam.
It is divided into 3 sections and split into total of 100%. Below are the description of these sections

## 1. Creating accessible web solutions(40%)
In this section, the main idea is to understand the WCAG 2.1 and it's limitations. Being able to distinguish and get deeper into different conformance levels. Then applying these knowledge into the programming concepts with the list of the best practices. Also, making sure that the quality assurance is done while the code is still in the implementation phase. Whether the code works in the specific Assistive technologies or not is also understand different types of assistive technologies. A good understanding of the standard html controls and the custom controls using WAI-ARIA. Know the differences in support for touch when screen reader is on vs. off. Make sure that the single page application focus control, delays for AJAX-Screen Reader compatibility, live announcements. A good understanding of the disabilities using web solution that is navigation of screen reader users, headings and landmarks, coping strategies, user preferred methods vs web specific methods like using keyboard vs mouse. A clear understanding of the overlap between user experience and accessibility.

## 2. Identifying accessibility issues in web solutions(40%) 
This section is now to identify issues with the interoperability and compatibility issues. Being able to use assistive technologies for example navigation of the screen reader users, heading and landmarks, screen magnifiers, high contrast, keyboard vs mouse. Test end user impact such as low vision, cognitive, mobile/touch. Have a good understanding of the automation and manual testing tools and their limitations. Several testing tools such as unit testing, browser based tools. spider tools, bookmarklet, automated tools used to monitor site vs external tools



## 3. Remediating issues in web solutions(20%)
Understand the severity and the the prioritization of the issues for example what are the benefits. user impact legal risk what is the problem. Recommending on how to solve the accessibility issues. Have an understanding of the best solution, feasibility of solution fixing vs redesigning and knowing how to fix it.
